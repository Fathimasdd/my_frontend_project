In the digital age, communication has transcended traditional boundaries, enabling real-time interactions across the globe. Recognizing the importance of seamless communication, I embarked on the development of a Real-Time Chat Application, a web-based platform designed to facilitate interactive and instantaneous messaging among users.The Real-Time Chat Application is built using a robust combination of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies form the backbone of the frontend, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. HTML5 ensures the structural integrity of the web application, while CSS is employed to craft a visually appealing and user-friendly design. JavaScript, on the other hand, brings the application to life by enabling dynamic interactions and real-time functionalities.
